We all face problems in our day to
day lives and it’s very simple to point
them out or wish for someone to
come and rectify it. Apart from facing
problems most us are unaware about
whom to pour our complains to.
We can’t guarantee or bring you a
helping hand, but with the help our
application we surely can direct you
towards it, as I quote“God helps
those who help themselves”
AAPAT, an application that we wish
to be every users go to for any kind
of emergency, will help you in every
way possible when you’re at
unknown place or travelling or for a
matter of fact at any given time.

### Key Features
* We provide a platform for users to click pictures on occurrence of any kind of inconvenience that
  they face while their travel or stay and register their complains at real time instead of opting to
  social media to share their grievances and waiting for them to get viral but being a medium
  between the government and the users we will leave it to the concerned authorities on how they   
  wish to further proceed on the complains.
* Users can add pictures, contact information of places like small mechanic shops, dispensary’s
  etc. tourists can visit when an ill fated event such as a car break down, accident or other such
  event occurs.
* Other users can add reviews and ratings to the above mentioned places.
* Dynamic display of nearby police station and hospitals.
* Keeping in mind the current situation of our country, people always try and know how crowded a
  place is at a given time our app would display the strength of crowd at a given location.
  
### Development Till Date

* Real time complain system.
* Dynamic display of near by police stations and hospitals.

### Future Prospects
The following features have to be worked upon :-

* Backend algorithms to display the best rated places to visit in times of need, on top.
